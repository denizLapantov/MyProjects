    On 29 November 1899, Joan Gamper founded FC Barcelona, along with eleven other enthusiasts of 'foot-ball'
    , a game that was still largely unknown in the country at the time. He could never have imagined the magnitude 
    of what that initiative would eventually develop into. Over more than one hundred years of history, FC Barcelona
    has grown spectacularly in every area and has progressed into something much greater than a mere sports club, 
    turning Barça’s ‘more than a club’ slogan into a reality.

Barça has become, for millions of people all around the world, a symbol of their identity, and not just in a sporting
    sense, but also in terms of society, politics and culture. Throughout the most difficult of times, Barça was the
    standard that represented Catalonia and the Catalan people's desire for freedom, a symbolism that has continued
    to be closely linked to the idiosyncrasy of the Club and its members to this day. Within the context of Spain,
    Barça is seen as an open and democratic club. And all around the world, Barça is identified with caring causes, 
    and most especially children through its sponsorship agreement with Unicef.

For a whole century, FC Barcelona has passed through moments of glory and pain, periods of brilliance and other less
    successful ones, epic victories and humbling defeats. But all these different moments have helped define the
    personality of a Club that, due to its peculiar nature, is considered unique in the world.

With over one hundred years of history, there have naturally been many different periods, both in a social and
    a sporting sense. In the early years (1899-1922) , from the foundation of the club to the construction of
    Les Corts stadium, Barça was a club that had to distinguish itself from all the other football teams in
    Barcelona, to the point that it would come to be identified with the city as a whole. Barça soon became the 
    leading club in Catalonia, and also associated itself with the increasingly growing sense of Catalan national identity.

From Les Corts to the Camp Nou (1922-1957), the club went through contrasting periods. Its membership reached 10,000
    for the first time, while football developed into a mass phenomenon and turned professional, and these were the
    years of such legendary figures as Alcántara and Samitier. But due to material difficulties and the political
    troubles of the Spanish Civil War and post-war period, the club was forced to overcome several adverse circumstances,
    including the assassination of president Josep Suñol in 1936, the very person who had propagated the slogan 
    ‘sport and citizenship'. But the club survived, and a period of social and sporting recovery materialised 
    in the form of the Camp Nou, coinciding with the arrival of the hugely influential Ladislau Kubala.

From the construction of the Camp Nou to the 75th anniversary (1957-1974), Barça suffered mediocre results but was
    consolidated as an entity, with a constantly increasing membership and the slow but steady recovery, in the face
    of adversity, of its identity. A very clear sensation that was manifested for the first time ever in the words
    ‘Barça, more than a club’ proclaimed by president Narcís de Carreras. The board presided by Agustí Montal brought 
    a player to Barcelona who would change the history of the club, Johan Cruyff.

From the 7th anniversary to the European Cup (1974-1992) the club saw the conversion of football clubs to democracy
    , the start of Josep Lluís Núñez’s long presidency, the extension of the Camp Nou on the occasion of the 1982 World 
    Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup triumph in Basel (1979), a major success not just in a sporting sense but also in a social one,
    with an enormous and exemplary expedition of Barça supporters demonstrating to Europe the unity of the Barcelona 
    and Catalan flags. Cruyff returned, this time as coach, and created what would come to be known as the 'Dream Team' 
    (1990-1994), whose crowning glory was the conquest of the European Cup at Wembley (1992), thanks to Koeman’s famous goal. 

From Wembley to the second treble (1992-2015) was when the club’s most recent developments occurred in between its
    seven greatest sporting, the five Champions League titles and the two World Club Cups. Josep Lluís Núñez’s
    long presidency came to an end, and the club displayed its finest potential during the celebrations of the 
    club Centenary. Following on from Joan Gaspart (2000-2003), the June 2003 election brought Joan Laporta into
    office, and the start of new social expansion, reaching 172,938 members, and more successes on the pitch, 
    including four league titles, the Champions League titles won in Paris and Rome and the FIFA Club World Cup.

In the season 2008/09 the arrival of Josep Guardiola as first team coach brought new energy to the club and they
    recorded the most successful season in their entire history winning the six titles that will be forever
    burned into the memories of all Barça fans. Success on the field has helped the club expand its social 
    role and heighten its media profile. In the 2009/10 season, Guardiola’s second in charge, the Liga title
    was won for the second year in a row, and the twentieth on club history, setting a new record of 99 points 
    in the process. The title was not decided until the very last day, with a game against Valladolid, and the 
    celebrations went ahead that very same evening in the company of the fans at the Camp Nou.

Under the presidency of Sandro Rosell (2010-14), the sporting glory continued with the league and Champions L
    eague double in 2010/11 and the World Club Cup and the Spanish Cup in the season 2011/12, the latter being 
    the last trophy claimed by Josep Guardiola as coach. Later, the league title in 2012/13 would be added with 
    Tito Vilanova as coach in the 100 points campaign. In the season 2014/15 with Josep Maria Bartomeu as president 
    and with Luis Enrique as coach, Barça recorded the second treble in their history, winning the league, the Spanish
    
    Cup and the Champions League
The grandeur of FC Barcelona is explained, among many other factors, by its impressive honours list. Very few club 
    anywhere in the world have won so many titles. The Intercontinental Cup is the only major football trophy that
    has never made its way into the club museum, where the club's greatest pride and joy remain the three European 
    Cup titles won in Wembley (1992) Paris (2006), Rome (2009), Wembley (2011) and Berlin (2015) and the FIFA Club
    World Cups in 2009 in Abu Dhabi and 2011 and 2015 in Yokohama.

Apart from winning Europe’s top title, the Club also has the honour of being the only one to have appeared in every
    single edition of European club competition since the tournaments were first created back in 1955. Barcelona's 
    many achievements in Europe include being considered 'King of the Cup Winners Cup', having won that title a record 
    four timesIn addition, FC Barcelona also won three Fairs Cups (the tournament now known as the UEFA Europa League) 
    in 1958, 1960 and 1966. In 1971, Barça won that trophy outright in a match played between themselves, as the first 
    ever winners of the competition, and Leeds United, as the last.
